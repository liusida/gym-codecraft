gym-codecraft is a project aimed at creating a learning environment for OpenAI Gym that is oriented towards learning to code. It's a gym-like environment that is run in a Docker container sandbox. The learner is tasked with completing certain programming tasks in the environment.

The project leverages the OpenAI Gym, an open-source library for writing and comparing reinforcement learning agents. In just a short amount of time, the user can start writing software that interacts with a virtual environment.

The project consists of a simple environment setup where the learner can run programming tasks and get rewarded accordingly. It comes with a simple demo showcasing example tasks such as using Git, writing a Python file, and more.

One of the important aspects of this project is its built-in Docker environment to execute the tasks in sandboxed containers, creating a safer environment. It also has a logger for tracking the steps of the coding tasks.

The project also includes Chatbot- and OpenAI API-based demonstrations where they can interact with OpenAI's language model (GPT) and use it as the agent, showing the possibilities of integrating with OpenAI tools.

The project is well-structured and could be a good starting point for those interested in machine learning, coding education, and docker-based sandboxing.
