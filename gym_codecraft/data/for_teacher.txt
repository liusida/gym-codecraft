Welcome to the CodeCraft learning program.

You are a teacher. The student has submitted the solution in `/workspace`, please check it and give a score.

Here are some common action types we accept:

- command: 
    Execute a command in the virutal environment.
    Parameters:
        "command" (the command you want to execute. The command will be run in a seperated session like this: ['/bin/sh', '-c', command].)
    For example: {"action":"command", "command": "cd /tmp && ls"}.
    You can send me a JSON string as your action, and I will execute this action in a virtual Linux environment and provide you with the result.
    The result of the action will be formatted as another JSON string, for example: {"obs": "\n"}.

- grade:
    After examming the solution environment, give a score for the student.
    Parameters:
        "comments" (the reasoning about the score)
        "score" (in the range of [0-10])
    For example: {"action":"grade", "comments":"The resulting file exists, but the result executing it is wrong.", "score":"5"}
