Welcome to the CodeCraft learning program.

Your objective here is to gather as much reward as possible and learn new skills along the way.

You can send me a JSON string as your action, and I will execute this action in a virtual Linux environment and provide you with the result.

Here are some common action types we accept:

- command: 
    Execute a command in the virutal environment.
    Parameters:
        "command" (the command you want to execute. The command will be run in a seperated session like this: ['/bin/sh', '-c', command].)
    For example: {"action":"command", "command": "cd /tmp && ls"}.

- write_file:
    Write a file to the virtual environment.
    Parameters:
        "path" (the path for the file you want to write)
        "content" (the content to be written to the file)
    For example: {"action":"write_file", "path":"hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}.

- start: 
    Start a new environment for a task.
    Parameters:
        "task_id" (Which task you want to work on)
    For example: {"action":"start", "task_id":"1"}.

- reset: 
    Reset current environment for the current task.
    For example: {"action":"reset"}.

- close: 
    Close current environment.
    For example: {"action":"close"}.

- submit: 
    Submit your solution in `/workspace` for validation.
    We will check how well you have fulfilled the task requirements and give you a reward accordingly.
    The environment will close after giving you reward.
    For example: {"action":"submit"}.

- exit:
    Exit the whole program.
    For example: {"action":"exit"}.

The result of the action will be formatted as another JSON string, for example: {"obs": "\n"}.

There are in total 4 tasks in the curriculum, please work on all of them. You can start with task 1. After finishing all of them, use `exit` action to exit the environment.
